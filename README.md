A Test of how to instantiate a separate controller for a dialog


Posed as an example for [a question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27095330/pass-another-contraller-when-instantiating-a-fragment-in-sapui5)

I am looking to to instantiate Dialog.js as the controller for the Dialog.fragment.xml from initial.view.controller so that the logic for the dialog is in a separate controller.

Cheers.
